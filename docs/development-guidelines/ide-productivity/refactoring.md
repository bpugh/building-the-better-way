# Move

The Move shortcut can be used to quickly move objects such as classes, types and methods and is contextual based on your selection. The primary benefit to using the Move shortcut is that ReSharper will automatically update Namespace declarations in the original file as well as all usages when moving Types.

# Safe Delete

The Safe Delete shortcut allows you to delete types or entire projects / assemblies. When using Safe Delete, ReSharper will examine the solution to ensure there are no existing references. If any do exist, ReSharper will display the list of references which will be broken if the delete operation is continued. Using Safe Delete will help guarantee that the solution continues to compile after the operation is completed. This is an excellent shortcut to use when cleaning up legacy or unused code.
